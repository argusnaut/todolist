# todolist
Project for practice of Java

Following a RocketSeat event, this repository has a purpose of archieving my studies to remember Java, that I didn't use since college.

## Technical choices
This project aims to use Spring Boot to set a Todo List on an web application.
For the Database, an H2 Database Engine was chosen, for its ease to set up, but only for this study environment.
